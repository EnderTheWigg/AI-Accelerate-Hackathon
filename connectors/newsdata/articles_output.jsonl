Trump has really pushed hard on this. Unfortunately, knowing our prime minister, Netanyahu, we fear he might once again find a way to derail the agreement.\u201dGil Shelly, another demonstrator, said: \u201cFor the first time in months, I truly feel hopeful. Trump has given us real confidence. We trust his leadership and believe he can lead us toward peace not only for the hostages\u2019 release but for an end to the war. Netanyahu only seems interested in continuing the fighting.\u201dAt the same time, hundreds of people in the UK, Spain, Italy, Portugal, and several other countries marched in solidarity with Palestinians, denouncing what they called \u201cgenocide in Gaza.\u201dProtesters demanded an immediate end to the war and condemned what they described as \u201cIsrael\u2019s abuse of power against Palestinians.\u201dIsabel Gadiana, a protester in Spain, said: \u201cMy emotions are strong. This is the first protest I\u2019ve joined. I just hope I can do something meaningful for Gaza, though I don\u2019t know if demonstrations alone can guarantee peace or end the genocide. Still, we must show up and do whatever we can.\u201dDaniela Abreu, from Portugal, added: \u201cOur message is simple, people are witnessing genocide, international law is being ignored, and our governments are doing nothing to stop the killings or free the detainees. Our message is clear: we want freedom for everyone, in every way.\u201dIn recent weeks, tensions in Gaza have escalated into one of the most severe crises in the Middle East.The conflict, now in its second year, has caused heavy casualties, widespread destruction, and mass displacement of Palestinians, sparking deep global concern.The United States has proposed a plan for a ceasefire and prisoner exchange to help bring an end to the war.Meanwhile, Hamas has expressed readiness to cooperate and release prisoners, but details of the agreement are still under negotiation, and the security situation in Gaza remains fragile.", "content": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS", "pubDate": "2025-10-05 10:27:38", "pubDateTZ": "UTC", "image_url": "https://tolonews.com/sites/default/files/2025-10/vlcsnap-2025-10-05-14h54m21s807.jpg", "video_url": null, "source_id": "tolonews", "source_name": "Tolonews", "source_priority": 61736, "source_url": "https://tolonews.com", "source_icon": "https://n.bytvi.com/tolonews.png", "language": "english", "country": "afghanistan", "category": "politics,top", "sentiment": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "sentiment_stats": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_tag": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_region": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_org": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_summary": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS", "ai_content": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "duplicate": false}, "table": "news_articles", "operation": "UPSERT"}

According to a report by WION, Russian officials dismissed the claim as \u201cillogical\u201d and clarified that there is \u201cno confirmation on such a development\u201d. The report quoted a Russian source as saying, \u201cWe don\u2019t have such a level of cooperation with Pakistan that would make India feel uncomfortable.\u201d \u201cSomeone is trying to compromise exceptionally promising and forward-looking cooperation, especially on the eve of high and highest-level contacts,\u201d the Russian source added, hinting that the reports may have been circulated to create diplomatic friction ahead of President Vladimir Putin\u2019s planned visit to India in December. Moscow\u2019s denial comes at a crucial time as India and Russia continue to deepen strategic and defence cooperation. From S-400 missile systems to nuclear and energy partnerships, the Indo-Russian relationship has remained one of the cornerstones of New Delhi\u2019s foreign policy for decades. President Vladimir Putin, speaking recently at the Valdai Discussion Club plenary session, praised India\u2019s leadership under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, describing him as a \u201cbalanced, wise, and nationally oriented leader.\u201d He also reaffirmed his commitment to visiting India later this year for the annual bilateral summit. Putin said he had instructed officials to expand imports of Indian agricultural products and pharmaceuticals to help correct the trade imbalance, which currently leans heavily towards Russian crude exports. \u201cI know Prime Minister Modi, he will never allow India to be humiliated by anyone. The Indian people will not tolerate it. India is a sovereign nation and will act in its national interest,\u201d Putin said, referring to Western attempts to pressure New Delhi over its continued engagement with Russia. Even before Russia\u2019s clarification, the opposition Congress party had seized upon the media reports to attack the Modi government, calling it a \u201cfailure of personalised diplomacy.\u201d Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh alleged that Prime Minister Modi\u2019s global image-building efforts had failed to protect India\u2019s strategic interests. In a post on X, Ramesh claimed that despite direct interventions by External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, Russia was proceeding with supplying advanced engines for Pakistan\u2019s JF-17 fighter jets. \u201cThe government owes the nation an explanation as to why a long-time and trusted partner like Russia is now providing military support to Pakistan, even as India continues to buy S-400 systems and negotiates for Su-57 fighters,\u201d Ramesh said. He further alleged that Modi\u2019s \u201cphoto-op diplomacy\u201d and \u201cgrandstanding on the world stage\u201d had yielded little in terms of tangible diplomatic outcomes, adding that India had \u201cfailed to diplomatically isolate Pakistan.\u201d The controversy revolves around the RD-93MA engine, an upgraded variant of the Russian-made RD-93 used in China-Pakistan\u2019s jointly developed JF-17 Thunder aircraft. The latest Block III version of the jet reportedly carries PL-15 missiles, believed to have been used during Operation Sindoor, raising security sensitivities for India. However, with Moscow\u2019s categorical denial, the reports appear to have no official backing, and experts suggest they might have originated as disinformation aimed at straining Indo-Russian ties. As the diplomatic dust settles, President Putin\u2019s upcoming visit to India in December is expected to reinforce bilateral trust and explore new areas of cooperation, including energy, defence technology, and trade diversification. \u201cNo such cooperation exists with Pakistan,\u201d the Russian official reiterated, signaling Moscow\u2019s intent to keep its partnership with India unaffected by speculative reports.", "content": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS", "pubDate": "2025-10-05 10:00:33", "pubDateTZ": "UTC", "image_url": "https://organiser.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/20220401275l-120x86.jpg", "video_url": null, "source_id": "organiser", "source_name": "Organiser Weekly", "source_priority": 225047, "source_url": "https://organiser.org", "source_icon": "https://n.bytvi.com/organiser.png", "language": "english", "country": "india", "category": "politics,top", "sentiment": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "sentiment_stats": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_tag": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_region": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_org": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_summary": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS", "ai_content": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "duplicate": false}, "table": "news_articles", "operation": "UPSERT"}
